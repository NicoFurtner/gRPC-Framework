# DEZSYS_GK72_ELECTION_GRPC
This lesson introduces the Remote Procedure Technology (RPC).

## Introduction
This exercise is intended to demonstrate the functionality and implementation of Remote Procedure Call (RPC) technology using the Open Source High Performance gRPC Framework gRPC Frameworks (https://grpc.io). It shows that this framework can be used to develop a middleware system for connecting several services developed with different programming languages.

Document all individual implementation steps and any problems that arise in a log (Markdown). Create a GITHUB repository for this project and add the link to it in the comments.

## Assessment
#### Requirements 체berwiegend erf체llt
Answer the questions below about the gRPC framework
Use one of the tutorials listed under "Links & Further Resources" to create a simple HelloWorld application using the gRPC framework
Create first the Proto-file where you define your gRPC Service and its data structures
Implement a gRPC server and gRPC client in a programming language of your choice
Document each single development step in your protocol and describe the most important code snippets in few sentences. Furthermore, the output of the application and any problems that occur should be documented in submission document.
#### Requirements zur G채nze erf체llt
Customize the service so that a simple ElectionData record can be transferred
Document which parts of the program need to be adapted
